# About ChessAI

ChessAI is a simple chess engine written in C++.  
It currently supports:

- Standard chess moves
- Pawn promotion
- Material-based board evaluation
- Castling (kingside and queenside)
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection

The AIPlayer class can play moves using a basic evaluation function, making it suitable for testing and educational purposes.  
Future updates will include more advanced evaluation heuristics and improved AI strategies.
